1. To start this project, I research first on what kind of tools I can use for project management.
2. I have noticed on myself that I work better if I have a macro view of the task. On this project we are asked to use IaC using Azure Bicep, since I am both unfamiliar with both of the concept, I decided to focus on the theory aspect first.

I decided to watch/do these:

- [Use Bicep to deploy your Azure infrastructure as code Ep1: Introduction to infrastructure as code using Bicep](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/shows/learn-live/use-bicep-deploy-azure-infrastructure-as-code-ep01-introduction-infrastructure-as-code-using-bicep?WT.mc_id=learnlive-20220308A)

1. I decided to follow what terminologies I don't know from the project pdf. Because I know, without knowing about these concepts, I won't know how the project should be in a big picture.

I decided to watch/do these:

- [What is infrastructure as code (IaC)?](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/devops/deliver/what-is-infrastructure-as-code)
- [Fundamentals of Bicep](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/paths/fundamentals-bicep/)

1. Today I focused on documentation. I don't have any specific to write here now.
