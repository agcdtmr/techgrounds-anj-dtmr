## Dagverslag (1 zin)

1. Allowed myself to have time to read the pdf where all the information about the details is explained
2. Find tools on how I can manage the project efficiently: github project, miro, timeblocking, whiteboarding
3. To start this project, I research first on what kind of tools I can use for project management.
4. I have noticed on myself that I work better if I have a macro view of the task. On this project we are asked to use IaC using Azure Bicep, since I am both unfamiliar with both of the concept, I decided to focus on the theory aspect first.

I decided to watch/do these:

- [Use Bicep to deploy your Azure infrastructure as code Ep1: Introduction to infrastructure as code using Bicep](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/shows/learn-live/use-bicep-deploy-azure-infrastructure-as-code-ep01-introduction-infrastructure-as-code-using-bicep?WT.mc_id=learnlive-20220308A)

## Obstakels & Oplossingen

1. Asking better questions

- [ ] How to start this project technically?

2. No clue how to start it. Especially that it was written in Dutch, but I start with noting down the words,
   that are not familiar, translate it, read the sentence again, then decide if it's important for the project or not.
3. The pdf has many words I could not comprehend with one reading,
   so I reread and reread until I understood.
4. The pdf has 12 pages, that could be overwhelming. I've creating bullet points and used a kanban method
   to ensure I miss nothing from the important details about the project itself.
5. Focus was a challenge because of the routine during and after the az-900, I created a gitHub project for
   myself where I have the important dates and information.

## Learnings

1. Bicep is a type of ARM template
