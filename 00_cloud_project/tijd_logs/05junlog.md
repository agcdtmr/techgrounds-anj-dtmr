## Dagverslag (1 zin)

1. Allowed myself to have time to read the pdf where all the information about the details is explained
2. Find tools on how I can manage the project efficiently: github project, miro, timeblocking, whiteboarding

## Obstakels & Oplossingen

1. Asking better questions

- [ ] How to start this project technically?

2. No clue how to start it. Especially that it was written in Dutch, but I start with noting down the words,
that are not familiar, translate it, read the sentence again, then decide if it's important for the project or not.
3. The pdf has many words I could not comprehend with one reading,
so I reread and reread until I understood. 
4. The pdf has 12 pages, that could be overwhelming. I've creating bullet points and used a kanban method
to ensure I miss nothing from the important details about the project itself.
5. Focus was a challenge because of the routine during and after the az-900, I created a gitHub project for
myself where I have the important dates and information.

## Learnings

1. Bicep is a type of ARM template
