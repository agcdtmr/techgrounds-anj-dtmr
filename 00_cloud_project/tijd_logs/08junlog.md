## Dagverslag (1 zin)

Today I focused on learning what Bicep is.

I successfully set up my environment too.

I decided to watch/do these:

- [Bicep documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/bicep/)

## Obstakels & Oplossingen

1. Asking better questions

- [ ] shall i first create a management server for my iac bicep project?
- [ ] hoe kan ik draw.io gebruiken met azure icons?

## Learnings

1. I learned how to set up my bicep environtment in VSCode.
2. Found out that I could visualize the bicep script using vscode.
3. Difference between imperative and declarative code.

Imperative code focuses on describing how to achieve a desired outcome step by step. It tells the computer exactly what to do and how to do it. In imperative code, you need to specify each individual action or operation to be performed.

On the other hand, declarative code focuses on describing what the desired outcome should be, without specifying the step-by-step process of achieving it. It allows you to declare the desired state or result, and the underlying system figures out how to achieve it. Declarative code is more focused on the end goal rather than the specific actions to get there.

To put it simply, imperative code tells the computer how to do something, while declarative code tells the computer what you want to be done, and it figures out the how on its own.
