## Dagverslag (1 zin)

1. Today, I decided to focus on understanding what the user stories are and its connection to the requirements we have. I used a miro board instead of a traditional kanban board, as this is more flexible.

## Obstakels & Oplossingen

1. Asking better questions

- [ ] To my team, what questions did you use to start writing about the assumptions?
- [ ] Do we need to use another github repository for the project? Or git tag should be enough?

2. My day was puzzling about how I can manage all these information, in a more systematic way of working.
   I used [miro board](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVMTGcfGo=/?share_link_id=416105946697) to map how I want to implement the project.

## Learnings

1. I can use Azure CLI on my MAC. Read the documentation first before installing anything.
