## Setting Up my IaC using Azure Bicep Environment

Prerequisites
To use Azure Bicep, you'll need a few tools set up on your local machine, all of which are available for macOS, Linux and Windows. These prerequisites include the following:

- [x] an integrated development environment, such as Visual Studio Code;
- [x] the Azure command line interface (CLI) installed and configured;
- [x] a Microsoft Azure account; and
- [x] optionally, the Bicep VS Code extension.

1. Install Azure CLI: This provides command-line access to Azure services and resources. Instructions can be found at: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli

2. Download & Launch Visual Studio Code

3. Install the Azure CLI Tools extension in Visual Studio Code: After launching our VSCode, we are going to search and install the Azure CLI tool in the extension tab.

4. Install the Azure Bicep CLI extension: This enables us to work with Bicep files.

5. Start Working with Azure CLI Tools in Visual Studio Code

`az login`

This will open Azure sign-in page on your default browser window. Click on the Signed In button and you will successful login to your Azure account.

We have successfully installed Azure CLI in Visual Studio Code and used it to access our Azure account.
