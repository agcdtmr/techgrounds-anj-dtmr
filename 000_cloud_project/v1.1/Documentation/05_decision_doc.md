Today I decide to focus on non-technical sides, as after I've read the v1.1 requirements. I don't know where to proceed anymore on my own project. I ask a network on how I can proceed to another version without forgetting or missing out any requirements from the old version. From there I follow the steps of the things I know and search for key terminologies that are unclear for me. I've made a draft planning for the next 3 weeks. Tomorrow I would like to ask question to my team mates and the learning coach (on q&a) on how to proceed smartly.
