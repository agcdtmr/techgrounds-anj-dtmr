Trial and full of errors days

I'm focusing on my management side today, because I heard from other trainees that it is the logical resources to do first.

I wanted to divide the bicep file into management network and web/app network. It was working individually accordingly, but when I was peering them, I could not get to find a way to connect them. At the end I decided to merge the two files into one and create a peering resource for each. It was a success.
