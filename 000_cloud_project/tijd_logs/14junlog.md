Wat zijn jou wins vandaag?-----

- Yesterday I was trying to deploy multiple resources at one time. I only got errors, did not gave up until the end of the day. But today to be much more productive and reach the deadline, I will code one resource at a time then test the deployment for each, one at a time too. Meaning they won't be connected with each other and might be deployed separately (let's see if I can do that within one resource group)

ex. of files:
network.bicep, storage.bicep,

then deploy them first one by one if they are working, then find a way to have a command to deploy them as a group
