June 5, 2023
Focused on understanding the project description. I don't have any specific to write here now focusing on improvements.

June 6, 2023
Focused on understanding every sentence of the project description. Start brainstorming how I want to plan this project.

June 7, 2023
Today I focused on documentation and planning. I don't have any specific to write here now.

June 8, 2023
Today I focused on learning bicep and IaC. I don't have any specific to write here now.

June 12, 2023
Today I focused on learning further about bicep. Deployed a resource group as I find it logical to do, because I remember when we were using the portal we also first make resource group and assign resources to it.

June 13, 2023
Trial and full of errors days

June 14, 2023
Today I was trying to deploy Azure Vnet to start the virtual network within the resource group I created. I would use it to connect the servers.

June 15, 2023
I'm focusing on my management side today, because I heard from other trainees that it is the logical resources to do first.

June 19, 2023
I wanted to divide the bicep file into management network and web/app network. It was working individually accordingly, but when I was peering them, I could not get to find a way to connect them. At the end I decided to merge the two files into one and create a peering resource for each. It was a success.

Today I decided to create my key vault first before the vm's from the 2 servers. This is to ready from the start, a place where I can keep my secrets.

June 21, 2023
Deployed key vault and storage account with container, before deploying the vmss.

June 23, 2023
Today I started with the difficult, deploy a vmss for the web server, since according to my notes the web server needs to be scalable with the best possible price still. But I only keep getting error from the quickstart template from microsoft. I decided to move on to recovery vault, but it seems like there is a problem with the API. So i moved forward with the management server and successfully deployed the cheapest server I could find. I spent the rest of the afternoon trying to understand the requirements for nsg and re-edit my code and successfully deployed it to.

The last few weeks is all discovery about my learning process. Today I asked someone to be a one on one buddy on this project, as I'm confident that would have a positive significant impact on how I can perform and give an mvp result for this project. We've talked about from the start, what we understand and NOT understand from the project
