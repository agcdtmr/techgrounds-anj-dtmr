# Start of my Cloud Engineering Career

Here I'm gonna try to document the steps I made

## Overcomed non-tech challenges + Results/ Image that can speak more than a thousand words:

Short description of the challeges encountered, and how I solved them:

**April 3, 2023**

Situation: It's our first day of training and we were given a kick-off presentations on how the training will run and given time to introduce ourselves. After the presentation we were grouped and assigned a breakout room.

Task: The first task is to read the important documents and begin on the first task which was git and github. Where at first, I noticed that we were working not as a team, doing the tasks in a very unstructured way and full of uncertainty how we will work together or even to understand the exercises given. 

Action: I suggested that we can first read the documents given, familiarize ourselves with the tools being used like, google docs, github and slack. And as someone who had beforehand experience with GitHub, I shared my screen to give a demo on how I would do the exercises and let my teammates share their screen too and try it on their own.

Result: We completely finished and submitted the first exercise on time and with detailed understanding of the key terminologies by discussing it one by one with the group. And make sure that everyone have a good understanding of how to use the tools and I noticed that everyone began to help one another in a more relaxed atmosphere.

Reflection: I was at first hesitant to lead the team, since I also have to speak in Dutch but that did not stopped me from sharing the things that I learned from the past.
