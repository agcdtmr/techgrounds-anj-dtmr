# OSI Stack

**What is Computer Networking?** The first thing that comes to my mind is communication. It is the way we, humans, communicate to one another to understand each other and possibly create something new out of it. Computer Networks is made up of nodes, nodes makes it possible for our devices like laptop, smartphone, tablet and servers and other devices to communicate and pass data or resources from one device to another. In human setting, node would be the people and language is the medium.

Networking can be wired and wireless, but of course to make wireless possible to, there's physical infrastracture somewhere too like switches, routers and access point.

Network relies on standard protocols such as HTTP, UDP/IP and TCP/IP. These protocols standardized how certain data should be sent or received.

Today transfering data is mostly like a blink of an eye.But before everything that we know on how computer transfer data from one device to another, these devices could not even talk with one another.

That's why these two models of computer networking below were developed.

Let's dive deeper on what, why, how and the different purposes and use. We first need to understand that both of these model determine how a specific device should be connected to the internet, according to purpose, security and use, and how data should be trasmitted between devices, internet to another devices.

**The TCP/IP model and its uses**

TCP/IP stands for Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol.

Have you ever wondered how you can troubleshoot a network problem? Or how an email you send from Florida is delivered to Tokyo in a matter of seconds? The magic behind it is the TCP/IP model.

A project developed in the 1970s by DARPA (the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency in the US), TCP/IP started out as just one of many internet protocols. The TCP/IP model later became the standard protocol for ARPAnet, the modern internetâ€™s predecessor. Today, TCP/IP is the global standard for internet communications.

| TRANSPORT   | 4     |
| NETWORK     | 3     |
| DATA LINK   | 2     |

**The OSI model and its uses**

Open Systems Interconnection networking reference model, unlike TCP/IP is widely referenced but isn't use in the real world. The Open Systems Interconnection model (OSI model) is a model primarily used for troubleshooting of telecommunication or computing systems.

| OSI          | LAYER |
| ------------ | ----- |
| APPLICATION  | 7     |
| Presentation | 6     |
| Session      | 5     |
| TRANSPORT    | 4     |
| NETWORK      | 3     |
| DATA LINK    | 2     |
| PHYSICAL     | 1     |

## Overcome challenges:

Short description of the challeges encountered, and how I solved them:

Issue 1: It was overwhelming because this is my first time learning about networking, it was especially difficult to understand the tech terminologies and connect them from each other. I open a lot of resources as much as I could, learn, note down, reread again and again until I can explain it myself to other person. I used ChatGPT in the end to have additional simplier explanation.

Issue 2: The education system from where I came from did not encouraged a student to ask a lot of questions, that's why I did not develop a skills to ask questions, how to formulate a good question and how to summarize a concept from what I just heard from other person, I tend to keep it to myself especially when I know that I understood it already and my brain is digesting at the same moment (another reason is that I notice that I'm a fast learner and keep missing a lot of small details like summarizing the concept verbally in return). With the help of the excellent rapport I built with my team mates, I make sure I take notes on how they explain things and how they answer from feedbacks.
