    2. ****Acknowledge the merit of the question****
    - ****What I do know (i.e. I’m still an expert):****
    - ****I know I don’t know (i.e. I’m human): Give me a moment.**** *Let me check the documentation… and get back to you via x before y* Or; …*I’m so sorry, my mind has gone blank. If it doesn’t come back to me, I’ll get the answer to you via x before y.*
    - ****Someone I know knows (I’m helpful): I*****’m not the best person to answer that.  Let me ask the other person who can explain it better,  Or Let me ask my teammate if they know more about this. **Or send a resources.***
    - ****I know I should know (i.e. I’m honest):**** *I should know that and I’m sorry I don’t.  I’ll get the answer to you via x before y.*

    - [ ]  **Be Yourself and Have Fun:** Again, just like in face-to-face presentations, **audiences connect to authenticity, so be yourself! Let your personality show through. Have fun. If you look like you’re enjoying the presentation so will others.** Research shows that happy people retain information better than bored or disinterested people, so model the energy that you want to create. The audience takes its cue from you.
    - [ ]  Remember, whether you are presenting in-person or virtually, **all presentations are performances. And all performances are in service to your audience. Their time is valuable, so honor that time by delivering the best presentation you can**. No matter what kind of presentation you are giving, you must find ways to create authentic audience connection, engagement, and value.
