# Azure Cost Management + Billing

Cloud answered the business solution of only paying what was used.

**The following principles can effectively reduce costs on Azure and optimize spending:**

Planning: creating a cost optimization plan before you begin using Azure services. It includes defining your objectives, identifying your priorities, setting budgets, and establishing cost controls. By planning ahead, you can avoid unexpected costs and optimize your usage of Azure resources.

Visibility: involves maintaining visibility into your Azure usage and spending. You should track your usage and spending, monitor your performance and utilization, and analyze your data to identify areas where you can optimize your costs. By maintaining visibility, you can make informed decisions about your usage and spending on Azure.

Accountability: involves holding yourself accountable for your Azure spending. You should establish clear roles and responsibilities, define ownership and accountability for your resources, and enforce policies and procedures for managing your usage and spending. By establishing accountability, you can ensure that your Azure usage aligns with your business objectives and priorities.

Optimization: involves continuously optimizing your usage of Azure resources to reduce costs. You should leverage automation, use Azure Advisor recommendations, and implement best practices for resource management to optimize your usage of Azure resources. By optimizing your usage, you can reduce unnecessary spending and maximize the value of your Azure investments.

Iteration: involves continuously iterating on your cost optimization strategies to improve your results. You should regularly review your usage and spending data, analyze your results, and adjust your strategies based on your findings. By iterating on your strategies, you can continuously improve your cost optimization and achieve greater cost savings over time.

**Azure provides several options for viewing spending. By using these tools and services, the clients can gain better visibility into Azure spending and make informed decisions to optimize costs. These include:**

Cost Management + Billing: This is a central hub in the Azure portal that allows you to view and manage your costs across all Azure services. You can view cost breakdowns by resource, service, or tag, set spending limits and alerts, and access detailed usage and billing reports.

Azure Cost Management APIs: These APIs allow you to programmatically access your cost and usage data in Azure. You can use these APIs to integrate cost data into your own applications or dashboards.

Azure Advisor: This is a free Azure service that provides personalized recommendations for optimizing your Azure resources and reducing your costs. You can view these recommendations in the Azure portal or through email notifications.

Azure Marketplace: The Azure Marketplace is a collection of certified and optimized Azure solutions from Microsoft and its partners. You can use the Marketplace to find and compare pricing for different Azure services and solutions.

**Azure cost management principles and tools:**

Free Subscription: Azure offers a free subscription with limited resources and services to help you get started with Azure at no cost. However, it's important to note that there are certain terms and conditions for the free subscription, such as limits on usage and duration.

**Azure free account**

1. 30 days $200 Azure credit
2. 55+ other services are **free always**. Keep getting monthly free amounts of these services for as long as you have an Azure account.
3. Popular services free for 12 months from the date you create your Azure account.

CAPEX vs OPEX: When it comes to financing IT projects, there are two types of expenses - capital expenditures (CAPEX) and operating expenses (OPEX). CAPEX refers to the upfront costs of purchasing and owning physical assets, such as servers or storage devices, while OPEX refers to the ongoing expenses of operating and maintaining those assets. Azure is an OPEX model, meaning you pay for what you use on a consumption basis, rather than owning and maintaining physical assets.

[TCO Calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/tco/calculator/): The Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) calculator is a tool provided by Azure to help you estimate the total costs of owning and operating an infrastructure on Azure compared to a traditional on-premises infrastructure. The calculator takes into account factors such as hardware, software, personnel, and other costs to provide a detailed comparison of costs between the two options. This helps make informed decisions about the most cost-effective solution for a business.

## Overcome challenges:

Short description of the challeges encountered, and how I solved them:

Issue 1: Asking better questions

- [ ] what is your budget is not the right question, but how both the company and client can have win-win result from using cloud computing
- [ ] What are the main purposes of Azure Cost Management? to provide cost analysis, budget, cost data export and recommendation related to it

[Issue 2:](https://github.com/techgrounds/techgrounds-anj-dtmr/blob/main/00_includes/week-4-includes/az-02-issue2.png) The forgot password attempt to access the azure portal did not work out. Reached out to our learning coach for assistance to create a temporary password.
