# Advantages of the cloud

The cloud delivers more flexibility and reliability, increased performance and efficiency, and helps to lower IT costs. It also improves innovation, allowing organizations to achieve faster time to market and incorporate AI and machine learning use cases into their strategies.

- High Availability: Afhankelijk van de service-level agreement (SLA)

Even when certain components fail, cloud computing infrastracture allows a system to continously function

What's the difference between SLA and Cloud Agreement?
An SLA makes sure that cloud providers meet the requirement of enterprise-level and give customers a defined set of deliverables. A cloud agreement is the same as any other contract. It's the blueprint that governs the relationship between the customer and the service provider

- Scalability: Zowel verticaal als horizontaal

Because of its infrastracture, cloud has the ability to **increase or decrease** resources according to the need and changing demand.

Three different types of cloud scalability - vertical, horizontal, and diagonal

- Elasticity

Cloud Elasticity is the property of a cloud to **grow or shrink** capacity for CPU, memory, and storage resources to adapt to the changing demands of an organization

- Agility

Cloud agility is the ability to quickly develop, test, and launch applications in a cloud-based environment. Much like in the athletic theater, agility makes it easier to move nimbly in response to changing environments or challenges.

- Geo-distribution
- Disaster recovery

Backing up applications, resources, and data into a cloud environment. Cloud disaster recovery (CDR) is a cloud-based solution or managed service that helps you quickly recover your organization’s critical systems after a disaster and provides you remote access to your systems in a secure virtual environment.

## Overcome challenges:

Short description of the challeges encountered, and how I solved them:

Issue 1: Asking better questions

- [ ] What are the difference between cloud and traditional datacenters?
- [ ] What is the use of API’s in cloud services?
- [ ] What is the difference between elasticity and scalability in cloud computing? Scalability is the ability of a system or network to handle increased load or usage. At the same time, elasticity is the ability to automatically expand and contract resources to meet demand
