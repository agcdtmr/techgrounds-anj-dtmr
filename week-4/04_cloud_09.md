# Introduction to Cloud Computing

Today, cloud represents a huge market, one that is continuing to grow at an unprecedented scale. Enormous computational power, once considered a prerogative of large enterprises, is now available at the fingertips of even the smallest of businesses and individual developers, thanks to Cloud. Moreover, the Cloud makes all this computational power highly affordable with pay-as-you-go economics. If you look at some of the key emerging technologies of our times, such as Artificial Intelligence, the Internet of Things, Blockchain and Analytics, all of these technologies work with massive amounts of data and need huge storage space and computational power in order to work, making cloud possibly the only viable platform for these technologies.

## Cloud computing

Cloud computing, also referred to as “the cloud,” is the delivery of on-demand computing resources. Everything from applications to data centers, over the internet on a pay-for-use basis.

## History

1950s - when large-scale mainframes with high-volume processing power became available. In order to make efficient use of the computing power of mainframes, the practice of time sharing, or resource pooling, evolved. Using dumb terminals, whose sole purpose was to facilitate access to the mainframes, multiple users were able to access the same data storage layer and CPU power from any terminal

1970s - with the release of an operating system called Virtual Machine or VM, it became possible for mainframes to have multiple virtual systems, or virtual machines, on a single physical node. The virtual machine operating system evolved the 1950s application of shared access of a mainframe by allowing multiple distinct compute environments to exist on the same physical hardware. Each virtual machine hosted guest operating systems that behaved as though they had their own memory, CPU, and hard drives, even though these were shared resources. Virtualization thus became a technology driver and a huge catalyst for some of the biggest evolutions in communications and computing

20 years ago - physical hardware was quite expensive. With the internet becoming more accessible, and the need to make hardware costs more viable, servers were virtualized into shared hosting environments, virtual private servers, and virtual dedicated servers, using the same types of functionality provided by the virtual machine operating system. So, for example, if a company needed ‘x’ number of physical systems to run their applications, they could take one physical node and split it into multiple virtual systems. This was enabled by hypervisors.

A hypervisor is a small software layer that enables multiple operating systems to run alongside each other, sharing the same physical computing resources. A hypervisor also separates the Virtual Machines logically, assigning each its own slice of the underlying computing power, memory, and storage, preventing the virtual machines from interfering with each other. If, for example, one operating system suffers a crash or a security compromise, the others keep working.

Since the servers were already online - the process of spinning up a new instance was instantaneous. Users could now order cloud resources they needed from a larger pool of available resources and they could pay for them on a per-use basis, also known as Pay-As-You-Go. This pay-as-you-go or utility computing model, became one of the key drivers behind cloud computing taking off. The pay-per-use model allowed companies and even individual developers to pay for the computing resources as and when they used them, just like units of electricity.

Modern-day cloud computing - This allowed them to switch to a more cash-flow friendly OpEx model from a CapEx model. This model appealed to all sizes of companies, those who had little or no hardware, and even those that had lots of hardware, because now, instead of making huge capital expenditures in hardware, they could pay for compute resources as and when needed. It also allowed them to scale their workloads during usage peaks, and scale down when usage subsided.

## Organization's transformation journey to cloud

Agility, flexibility, and competitiveness are key drivers for moving to the cloud, provided it is done without creating business disruption or issues related to security, compliance and performance.

1. The first consideration is infrastructure and workloads. The cost of building and operating data centers can become astronomical. On the other hand, low initial costs and pay-as-you-go attributes of cloud computing can add up to significant cost savings. Also, a point to consider is that not all workloads may be ready for the cloud, as is.

2. The second consideration is around SaaS and development platforms. Organizations need to consider if paying for application access is a more viable option than purchasing off-the-shelf software and subsequently investing in upgrades. Organizations also need to consider speed and productivity, what it means for them to get a new application up and running in ‘x’ hours on the cloud versus a couple of weeks, even months on traditional platforms. And the person-hour cost efficiencies they gain from using cloud dashboards, real-time statistics, and active analytics.

3. Lastly, organizations need to consider the impact of making a wrong decision, their risk exposure. Is it riskier, for example, for them to invest in the hardware and software or rent by the hour? Is it safer for them to work on a 12-month plan to build, write, test, and release the code if they’re uncertain about adoption? And is it better for them to “try” something new paying-as-you-go rather than making long-term decisions based on little or no trial or adoption?

## Benefits of cloud adoption - Flexibility, Efficiency, and Strategic Value

1. Cloud gives us flexibility. Users can scale back or scale up services to fit their needs, customize applications, and access cloud services from anywhere with an internet connection. Cloud infrastructure scales on demand to support fluctuating workloads. Organizations can determine their level of control with as-a-service options. Users can select from a menu of pre-built tools and features to build a solution that fits their specific needs. And Virtual Private Clouds, encryption, and API keys help keep data secure.

2. Cloud also brings great efficiency. Enterprise users can get applications to market quickly without worrying about underlying infrastructure costs or its maintenance. Cloud-based applications and data are accessible from virtually any internet-connected device. Hardware failures do not result in data loss because of networked backups. Cloud computing uses remote resources, saving organizations the cost of servers and other equipment, and paying on use-basis. Cloud services give enterprises a competitive advantage by providing the most innovative technologies available while managing the underlying infrastructure, thus enabling organizations to focus on their priorities.

## Risks using cloud service

Data security, associated with loss or unavailability of data causing business disruption; Governance and sovereignty issues; Legal, regulatory, and compliance issues; Lack of standardization in how the constantly evolving technologies integrate and interoperate; Choosing the right deployment and service models to serve specific needs; Partnering with the right cloud service providers; Concerns related to business continuity and disaster recovery

The question for businesses today is no longer “if” they need to adopt the cloud, rather “what” their cloud adoption strategy should be to best serve their businesses and customers.

# Case studies

1. Bitly - Cloud provider: Google Cloud Platform and Amazon Web Services
   Bitly is best known for shortening URLs, making them easier to share across all channels, including text messages, emails and social media posts, where words and characters are at a premium. Bitly's links garner more than 12 billion clicks per month, generating over 250 billion unique data points. Through the company's Link Management Platform, marketers create branded links, add mobile deep linking capabilities, track user interactions and analyze audience data in order to better engage with customers.

2. PayPal - Cloud provider: Google Cloud
   PayPal serves more than 300 mln users worldwide having processed over 3.74 billion transactions in just the first quarter of 2021. From the standpoint of a single user, PayPal is just a convenient service for online payments. However, when you look at the whole picture, the company requires astounding operational power to manage the sheer volume of daily transactions all the while maintaining top security, addressing financial risks, and preventing fraud. All this is made possible after partnering up with Google Cloud in 2018.

3. Apple's Siri -
   When Apple developed Siri, a computer that imitates a human being and assists users by asking inquiries, it revolutionized the entire mobile phone technology. Although Siri’s voice is remarkable, the way she operates is much more so. The cloud receives and processes user inquiries before it responds to them.

Users may also utilize the cloud to exchange data, apps, and upgrades without having to make any physical modifications to their hardware or software. In fact, the majority of people are familiar with Apple’s cloud program, iCloud.

4. Netflix -
   From its beginnings as a DVD rental business, this streaming service has gone a long way. It commands the attention of millions of people who are eager to watch one of its hundreds of critically acclaimed programs, films, or documentaries.
   Netflix needed to find a method to store all of its data due to its large user base, and a typical in-house data center was rapidly becoming too inefficient. They required scalability in their infrastructure.
   Netflix claims that its 117.58 million global customers view 140 million hours of video each day. Simply said, the typical Netflix customer spends 1 hour and 11 minutes each day on the site or 71 minutes per day.
   What’s so amazing about Netflix is how they were able to move all of that data at a time when cloud computing was still a relatively new technology.

5. Salesforce -
   Salesforce Customer Data Platform uses AWS DataSync's Cross-Cloud Feature to Deliver Personalization. Salesforce's Customer Data Platform (CDP) strives to connect all your customer data at scale to provide you with a complete view of your customers' experience and activity.

## New era of Technologies - Internet of Things, Big Data, artificial intelligence, and blockchain

1. The Internet of Things, or IoT, is a giant network of connected things and people that have changed much of how we live our daily lives - from the way we drive, to how we make purchases, monitoring our personal health, and even how we get energy for our homes. Smart devices and sensors are continuously tracking and collecting data. For example, a smart building could have thousands of sensors measuring all kinds of data related to thermal, optical, structural, and environmental stimuli. An unprecedented amount of data is being generated, putting a tremendous strain on the Internet. That is where the cloud comes in, by connecting the IoT device user to the cloud - be it for device registration, device identity, storing data, or accessing enterprise data. Data collected through IoT devices is stored and processed on the cloud since IoT devices can be in a state of motion, the cloud serves as a collection point in closest proximity, minimizing the latency in reporting up the data points and providing a response back to the IoT application. So, from IOT platforms running entirely on the cloud to the interfaces used by customers to interact these devices, to the backend analytics platforms - cloud computing supports and enables IoT. Cloud service providers also offer specialized IoT services designed to help speed up the development of IoT solutions.

IoT devices generate a huge amount of data, which needs to be stored somewhere. Cloud Computing provides the storage and processing power needed to make use of this data. It also provides apps that can be used to analyze and visualize the data.

ex. rhinos in africa, alexa, smartwatch,

2. Many of the applications where we apply AI today simply wouldn't have been possible without the scalable, on-demand computing offered by the cloud. There is a three-way relationship between AI, IoT, and Cloud. Just as AI consumes the data produced by IoT devices, the IoT devices’ behavior can be dictated based on responses from AI. For example, Smart Assistants, a common type of IoT device, continues to learn about the user’s preferences as usage grows, such as the songs they like, their home temperature settings, preferred meal times, and over time they anticipate their actions based on the user’s past history. So, what we see is a symbiotic relationship between IoT, AI, and Cloud. IoT delivers the data, AI powers the insights, and both these emerging technologies leverage cloud’s scalability and processing power to provide value to individuals and businesses alike.

AI on the cloud is a powerful technology that can automate repetitive tasks, improve decision-making and increase productivity.

ex. smart home assistants, chatgpt, tennis association

## Five essential characteristics

The 1st characteristic - On-demand Self-service means that you get access to cloud resources such as the processing power, storage, and network you need, using a simple interface, without requiring human interaction with each service provider.

The 2nd characteristic - Broad Network Access means that cloud computing resources can be accessed via the network through standard mechanisms and platforms such as mobile phones, tablets, laptops, and workstations.

The 3rd characteristic - Resource Pooling is what gives cloud providers economies of scale, which they pass on to their customers, making cloud cost-efficient. Using a multi-tenant model, computing resources are pooled to serve multiple consumers; cloud resources are dynamically assigned and reassigned, according to demand, without customers needing to concern themselves with the physical location of these resources.

The 4th characteristic - Rapid Elasticity implies that you can access more resources when you need them, and scale back when you don’t, because resources are elastically provisioned and released.

The 5th characteristic, Measured Service means that you only pay for what you use or reserve as you go. if you’re not using resources, you’re not paying. Resource usage is monitored, measured, and reported transparently based on utilization.

Summary: Cloud computing is really about utilizing technology “as a service”, leveraging remote systems on-demand over the open internet, scaling up and scaling back, and paying for what you use. It is a revolution in that it has changed the way the world consumes compute services, by making them more cost-efficient while also making organizations more agile in responding to changes in their markets.

## Three deployment models

1. Public cloud is when you leverage cloud services over the open internet on hardware owned by the cloud provider, but its usage is shared by other companies.

2. Private cloud means that the cloud infrastructure is provisioned for exclusive use by a single organization. It could run on-premises or it could be owned, managed, and operated by a service provider.

3. And when you use a mix of both public and private clouds, working together seamlessly, that is classified as the Hybrid model

## Three service models - Infrastructure, Platform, and Applications.

1. Software as a Service (SaaS) is a software licensing and delivery model in which software and applications are centrally hosted and licensed on a subscription basis, and sometimes also referred to as "on-demand software." Analogy: When you're getting a taxi/uber. You're not driving, not paying for the gas or toll fees because it's fix into the price but only paying for the service. Users: If you're using a YouTube then you are a user of a SaaS.

2. In a Platform as a Service model (PaaS) you get access to the platform, that is the hardware and software tools, usually those needed to develop and deploy applications to users over the Internet. Analogy: When you're on vacation and you are renting a car, you don't care what color it is, dont care about the specs, but you're still driving and paying the gas & toll fees. User: Dev

3. Infrastructure as a Service model (IaaS) you get access to infrastructure and physical computing resources such as servers, networking, storage, and data center space - without the need to manage or operate them. Analogy: buying your own car comes with all the responsibility such as buying own insurance, bringing it to maintenance, cleaning it yourself, you care what model, what color, which design and you're the one driving and the one paying for the gas. Users: IT/System Admin

## Data needs encryption in three states

- Encryption at rest - protecting data while it is stored
- Encryption in transit - protecting data while it is transmitted from one location to another
- Encryption in use - protecting data when it is in use in memory
