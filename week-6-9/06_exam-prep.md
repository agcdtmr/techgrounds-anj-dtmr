## Notes

SLA -> Service Level Agreement (SLA) is a formal agreement between a service provider and a customer.

SLA is a promise of a service’s availability (uptime & connectivity). Availability is a measure of time that a service remains operational.

Each Service has its own SLA
Ranges from 99% to 99.999%
Free services typically don’t have an SLA
Broken SLA means service credit return (discount)
