Exercise 1:

- [x] Create a new script.
- [x] Create a variable x and give it the value 0.
- [x] Use a while loop to print the value of x in every iteration of the loop. After printing, the value of x should increase by 1. The loop should run as long as x is smaller than or equal to 10.

Exercise 2:

- [x] Create a new script.
- [x] Copy the code below into your script.

```for i in range(10):

# do something here
```

- [x] Print the value of i in the for loop. You did not manually assign a value to i. Figure out how its value is determined.
- [x] Add a variable x with value 5 at the top of your script.
- [x] Using the for loop, print the value of x multiplied by the value of i, for up to 50 iterations.

Exercise 3:

- [x] Create a new script.
- [x] Copy the array below into your script.
      `arr = ['Coen', 'Casper', 'Joshua', 'Abdessamad', 'Saskia']`
- [x] Use a for loop to loop over the array. Print every name individually.
