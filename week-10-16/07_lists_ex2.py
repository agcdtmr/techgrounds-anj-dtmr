# Exercise 2:
# ● Create a new script.
# ● Create a list of five integers.

five_int = [0, 77, 34, 55, 9]
print(f"This is my list: {five_int}")

# ● Use a for loop to do the following for every item in the list:
# Print the value of that item added to the value of the next item in the list. If it is the
# last item, add it to the value of the first item instead (since there is no next item).

for i in range(len(five_int)):
    print(i)

    ls_length = len(five_int)
    new_list = []

if i
added_num = five_int[i] + five_int[i+1]
    new_list.append(added_num)
    print(new_list)


# ● The first result above is created by adding 9 and 80. The second result is created by
# adding 80 and 16, etc. The last result is created by adding 35 and 9.
