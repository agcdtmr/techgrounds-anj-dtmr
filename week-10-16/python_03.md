Exercise 1:

- [x] Create a new script.
- [x] Copy the code below into your script.
      a = 'int'
      b = 7
      c = False
      d = '18.5'
- [x] Determine the data types of all four variables (a, b, c, d) using a built in function.
- [x] Make a new variable x and give it the value b + d. Print the value of x. This will raise an error. Fix it so that print(x) prints a float.
- [x] Write a comment above every line of code that tells the reader what is going on in your script.

Exercise 2:

- [x] Create a new script.
- [x] Use the input() function to get input from the user. Store that input in a variable.
- [x] Find out what data type the output of input() is. See if it is different for different kinds of input (numbers, words, etc.).
