# June 26, 2023 Monday Standup

READ THIS BEFORE THE START OF EVERYTHING
guiding principles:

1st, I am Not here for short sprints, I'm here for the marathon-long-term commitment. I'll take 100% responsibility to motivate myself. By learning to be more creative on managing my frustrations better, consistent with my learning: 8:30 I set my mind, active recalling and taking care of myself: enough breaks, hydrate, stretch. and keep improving my inquisitiveness by starting to ask even the question is not perfect.

2nd, As a peer, I ask and Clear Expectations, I am honest, I am proactive, leading supportively, Striving for efficiency, Encouraging and helpful, solution-oriented, Constructive on my feedback, Act respectfully and Celebrating diversity.

3rd, Learning Requires Consistent Effective Action. I'll keep experimenting what works for me, like time-blocking, pomodoro, doing flashcards, Work in my designated work space from 9-17, not checking slack or work related during the weekends. (I could do that because I finish all my task for the week, in case not I am blocking a time during the weekends to continue).
