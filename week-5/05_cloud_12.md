# Well-Architected Framework

The Azure Well-Architected Framework helps to design, build, and continuously improve a secure, reliable, and efficient application.

By thinking of the Azure Well-Architected Framework as a blueprint for building a house. Just like a house needs a solid foundation, sturdy walls, and a roof that can withstand different weather conditions, a cloud-based application needs a strong architecture to support its functionality and scale.

Azure Well-Architected Framework is divided into five pillars of architectural best practices:

- Cost Optimization (How can you achieve your non-functional requirements while keeping cost low?) Azure Cost Management and Azure Advisor to monitor and optimize spending.
- Reliability (How are you protecting against potential failures in the system?) Azure Site Recovery and Azure Backup to protect data and ensure high availability.
- Operation Excellence (Technical architecture is one aspect of your solution, but are you prepared to monitor and run the system when it goes live?) Azure Monitor and Azure Automation to monitor and automate operations.
- Performance Efficiency (Have you considered how your application scales as part of your design?) Azure CDN and Azure Cache for Redis to improve the performance of application.
- Security (What happens if someone tries to attack your solution?) Azure Security Center and Azure Key Vault to secure applications and data.

Een ezelsbruggetje om deze pilaren te kunnen onthouden is ook wel CROPS.

## Overcome challenges:

Short description of the challeges encountered, and how I solved them:

Issue 1: Asking better questions

- [ ] How can a Cloud Engineer implement these different pilars without sacrificing the other?
- [ ] How can I use these pilars with different Azure services, how can I decide which to priortize?
